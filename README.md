# PointwiseNet
Pointwise Geometric and Semantic Learning Network on 3D Point Clouds

## Introduce
In this work, we strive to impart machines with the knowledge of 3D object shapes, thereby enabling machines to infer the **high-level semantic information** of the 3D model. We propose a novel network for 3D shape analysis that combines pointwise **low-level geometric** and **high-level semantic** information, named pointwise geometric and semantic learning network (**PointwiseNet**). In a series of experiments with popular 3D shape analysis benchmarks, our network exhibits competitive performance in many important tasks, such as 3D object classification, 3D object part segmentation, semantic segmentation in scenes, and commercial 3D CAD model retrieval.
